# Linear Regression Model for Single Feature

Linear Regression is a linear approach to modelling the relationship between a scalar response (or dependent variable) and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables). Here we are given 2 variable in example data which we assign to X and y variable and try to find some useful insights for prediction.

Relevant Equation for this:
