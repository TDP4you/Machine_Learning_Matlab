# Logistic Regression Regularized (Matlab)

I have build a regularized logistic Regression model to predict whether microchips from a fabrication plant passes quality assurance (QA). The dataset contains the test results for some microchips on two different tests. From these two tests, you would like to determine whether the microchips should be accepted or rejected.
